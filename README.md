# Lambda School Data Science - Unit 2 - Sprint 2


## Kaggle Challenge

We’ll continue our study of predictive modeling with tree-based models, such as decision trees and random forests.

We’ll also learn how to clean data with outliers, impute missing values, encode categoricals, and engineer new features.

This sprint, your project is about water pumps in Tanzania. Can you predict which water pumps are faulty?
